## trap data question, delete repo after 03-10-22 to clear repo space 

zsd quesion

so my question was why are there so many high numbers data points for 
the now_total with the biolours but lower for the ppo and the ovabate traps? 
Was it a proficency in the biolours or the trap type like a long arm or short 
arm or was it another thing in one of the experiments?

The data set is explored using DescTools, processed using dply, and plotted
for presentation using ggplot2 (jpg for use in Word, PowerPoint)
