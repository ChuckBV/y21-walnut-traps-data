###trap data question, delete repo after 03-10-22 to clear repo space 

##zsd quesion
so my question was why are there so many high numbers data points for the now_total with the biolours but lower for the ppo and the ovabate traps? Was it a proficency in the biolours or the trap type like a long arm or short arm or was it another thing in one of the experements?
